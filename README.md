- 👋 Hi, I’m @XpepeD
- My name is Ildar Khairullin
- 👀 I've been studying Python for a little over a year.
📫 I know the basic syntax and additional built-in libraries, some third-party libraries for data analysis (pandas, numpy) and data parsing (beatifullsoup4, requests, selenium), and I also know the basics of object-oriented programming.
🌱 I continue to study various libraries and frameworks, in addition to parsing and data analysis, I am interested in the topics of web development, machine learning and working with databases. Therefore, I also know SQL, html, css quite well.
   In addition to programming languages, I try to learn English, Turkish and German.
💞️ My dream: to become a great specialist in several areas of programming and work in cool IT companies like: Google, Yandex, Tinkoff, etc.
